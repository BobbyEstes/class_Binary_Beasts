        <h1>Louis Tomlinson</h1>
        <p>
          Tomlinson was born in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, to Johannah "Jay"
          Poulston and Troy Austin, who split up when he was a toddler. He is
          estranged from his father. He later took on his then stepfather Mark
          Tomlinson's name. He has six half siblings from his mother;
          entrepreneur Lottie (born 1998), Félicité (2000–2019), and twins
          Phoebe and Daisy (born 2003) from Poulston's marriage to Mark. As well
          as twins Doris and Ernest (born 2014) from Poulston's marriage to Dan
          Deakin. He has one half-sibling, Georgia, from his father.

          Tomlinson was a sixth form student at Hall Cross School and is a
          former pupil of the Hayfield School. He failed his first year of A
          levels at the Hayfield School and ended up going back to Hall Cross
          and starting A levels again. He had a number of jobs, including at a
          Vue cinema and at Doncaster Rovers football stadium as a waiter in the
          hospitality suites. Tomlinson, along with two of his siblings, had
          extra roles in Fat Friends. After Fat Friends, he attended an acting
          school in Barnsley. He had small parts in an ITV drama film If I Had
          You and BBC's Waterloo Road. At Hall Cross, Tomlinson appeared in
          several musical productions. He admitted to not applying himself
          academically in school, but he thoroughly enjoyed being with his
          friends and being involved with musical productions. Taking the lead
          role of Danny Zuko in the Hall Cross musical production of Grease
          motivated him to audition for The X Factor.
