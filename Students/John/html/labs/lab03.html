            A child’s world gets a little bigger every time they step—or crawl,
            or roll, or hop!—into a Shine a Light classroom. Here they can build
            a skyscraper, cook an imaginary feast, or heal a teddy bear’s runny
            nose. Everything in our classrooms is designed around their unique
            needs.
          </p>

            We’re more than educators. We help families build confidence for
            life. Our programs give children a foundation they can build on.
            Wherever they go after they leave Shine a Light, they’ll be ready to
            think bigger, feel stronger, and aim higher.

              "I enrolled my son in this Shine a Light center when he was 13
              months old. I interviewed approximately 20 child care programs.
              The process of elimination began with the first phone call. Not
              only was the first phone call pleasant and inviting, but once I
              entered the building I noticed all of the teachers greeting each
              child by name."

              has been a part of our family for almost nine years. We enrolled
              at Shine a Light in 2001 when Steven was six weeks old. Since then
              he has grown and matured into an amazing, intelligent young man."

              talks fondly of her teachers. In fact, she even said that one of
              her teachers "loves me" when she was two. Even at three, I still
              receive daily reports, which tell me how she eats, sleeps and
              plays. That can tell me a lot about any changes in her moods in
              the evenings."
