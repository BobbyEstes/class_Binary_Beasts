    <div class="post">A teenager who needs money takes a job at a fast food restaurant, where he befriends the employees and gets caught up in a rivalry with the evil Mondo Burger. Dexter is your typical carefree teenager excited for summer... until, after borrowing his mother's car without her permission, he slams into the beloved car of his teacher, Mr. Wheat. Dexter doesn't have a license or insurance, so Mr. Wheat threatens to call the cops until Dexter insists he can raise the money to pay for the damages. Dexter applies for a job at the soon-to-open massive fast food restaurant, Mondo Burger, but his jokey attitude clashes with the deadly serious demeanor of their psychotic manager, Kurt. Dexter is forced to go across the street to the local burger shack, Good Burger, where he meets Ed, a simple-minded but good-natured cashier who constantly finds himself getting into trouble. Once Mondo Burger opens, the sheer size of its beef patties draws the customers, and it seems Good Burger may go out of business-- leaving Dexter in a tough spot. However, one day, Dexter discovers that Ed makes his own sauce, and it is absolutely delicious. After Dexter makes Ed sign a contract that gives him most of the extra money Ed can earn off of the sauce, Good Burger regains its popularity with the sauce's help. Kurt attempts to replicate the sauce to no avail, and he tries stealing the sauce recipe from Ed in a number of ways, but Ed loves Good Burger too much to give it away. When Dexter and Ed find out that Mondo Burger has been adding dangerous chemicals to its meat in order to make the patties bigger, Kurt locks them away in a mental ward. They escape the ward, race back to Good Burger in time to thwart a scheme involving poisoning Ed's sauce, and Ed pours all the chemicals into Kurt's meat grinder, causing the burgers to become so large that the Mondo Burger explodes. Dexter gets his money, Kurt goes to jail, and Ed emerges a hero.</div>
